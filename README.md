# MalwareTagDB

## Project description

### **Acquiring and tagging a mobile device Malware database**

The objective of this project is the compilation of a database of Android mobile apps from public repositories, which will be automatically multi-tagged based on the query of known detection engines.

---
## Tools
- **Python** is the programming language used.
- **PostgreSQL** is the database used.
- **VirusTotal** used to analyze the acquired apks, and if they are malware, apply multi-tagging.

---

## Installing requirements
    pip install -r requirements.txt


## Database preparation
First, set the credentials in the _/db/database.ini_ file.

Then, create the database and import the database (_database.sql_):

    sudo -u postgres psql -c 'create database database_name;'

    pg_restore -h localhost -d database_name -U postgres database.sql

## Run program
To run the program, you need a VirusTotal API key.

To obtain it, you just need to register on the [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us) page and access the following link: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/user/{username}/apikey

Where {username} is the user with whom you have registered your account.

Then, it is necessary to use the key next to the _**-k**_ argument to start parsing the hashes found in the  _apks_hashes/list_of_selected_sha256_ file.

    python3 apkcollector.py -k [VirusTotal API key] (-d True)
